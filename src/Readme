1.The unzipped tar xxx-project3.tar.gz file contains the following files
a.src directory   
b.gen-java containing the generated java stub code for twophase.thrift 
c.MakeFile to compile the controller and branch source code.  
d.testclient.sh :- shell script to invoke the test cases. 
e.testserver.sh :- shell script to invoke the test server.
f.testtool.thrift :- Thrift file to generate test stub classes.
g.client.sh:-Shell script to invoke the client. 
h.coordinator.sh :- Shell script to invoke the coordinator.
i.replica.sh :- Shell script to invoke the participant replicas.
j.twoPhase.thrift:-  Thrift file to generate two face interface stub classes.


Description on source files :

Client.java :- Simple thread server which takes read and write requests and outputs on the screen
   
Coordinator.java:- Coordinator is created as  TthreadPoolServer which accepts requests from clients and process accordingly.
  
CoordinatorHandler.java :- Implements Coordinator Interface to handle read and write requests. It uses Sqlite internally to log the 
						   transactions  


InterfaceConstants.java:- All the interface constants are defined with in this class.

LogEntry.java:- This class hold the attributes of log results, which are used during recovery for coordinator and participants

Operation.java:- Enumeration class  containing Read and Write attributes.

Participant.java:- Participant Replica is implemented as TThreadPoolServer. It process the read and write requests recieved from coordinator.  


ParticipantHandler.java :-This class ParticipantHandler is implementation of  ParticipantFileStore.Iface
						   Process the requests of write and read from coordinator 
						   Takes decision and sends vote to coordinator, persists the files in permanent file system
						   Uses sql-lite to log the transactions.
 

TestToolServer: is TThreadPoolServer which runs on individual machines of coordinator and particpants to execute the testcases 


TestToolHandler: implements TestToolThrift interface used to intialize the testcases to individual participants and coordinator   


TestClient: contains main method to invoke TestTool Server to execute the test cases.



Steps to execute the two phase commit implementation.

Step1:
How to compile :

Run the command "make" in the location  where MakeFile is found, the source code is 
compiled and  put into "bin\" directory 

Step:2
How to execute  test cases :





Step3 :

How to :
